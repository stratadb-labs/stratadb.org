The Vector Store holds embedding vectors in named collections and supports similarity search. Use it for RAG context, agent memory, and any workflow that involves finding similar items.

## Command Overview

| Command | Syntax | Returns |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `vector create` | `vector create <name> <dim> [--metric M]` | OK |
| `vector drop` | `vector drop <name>` | OK |
| `vector collections` | `vector collections` | All collections |
| `vector stats` | `vector stats <coll>` | Collection details |
| `vector upsert` | `vector upsert <coll> <key> <vector> [--metadata JSON]` | OK |
| `vector batch-upsert` | `vector batch-upsert <coll> <json>` | OK |
| `vector get` | `vector get <coll> <key>` | Vector data |
| `vector del` | `vector del <coll> <key>` | OK |
| `vector search` | `vector search <coll> <query> [k] [--metric M] [--filter JSON]` | Top-k matches |

## Collections

Before storing vectors, create a collection with a fixed dimension and distance metric:

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create embeddings 384 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector create positions 3 --metric euclidean
OK
strata:default/default> vector create scores 128 --metric dot
OK
```

### Distance Metrics

| Metric | Best For | Score Range |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `cosine` | Text embeddings, normalized vectors | [-1, 1] (higher = more similar) |
| `euclidean` | Spatial data, positions | (0, 1] (higher = more similar) |
| `dot` | Pre-normalized embeddings, scoring | Unbounded (higher = more similar) |

All metrics are normalized so that **higher scores = more similar**.

### List Collections

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create embeddings 384 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector collections
embeddings: 384 dimensions, cosine metric, 0 vectors
```

### Collection Statistics

Get detailed information about a specific collection:

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create embeddings 384 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector stats embeddings
name: embeddings
count: 0
dimension: 384
metric: cosine
index_type: flat
memory_bytes: 0
```

### Delete a Collection

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create old-collection 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector drop old-collection
OK
```

## Index Backends

The Vector Store supports two index backends:

| Backend | Complexity | Recall | Best For |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Brute Force** | O(n) exact | 100% | Collections < 10K vectors |
| **HNSW** | O(log n) approximate | ~95%+ | Collections 10K+ vectors |

The default backend is **Brute Force**. HNSW can be selected per collection at creation time via the engine-level configuration.

### HNSW Configuration

The HNSW backend accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `m` | 16 | Max connections per graph layer |
| `ef_construction` | 200 | Beam width during index build (higher = better recall, slower build) |
| `ef_search` | 50 | Beam width during search (higher = better recall, slower search) |
| `ml` | 1/ln(m) | Level multiplier for probabilistic layer assignment |

## Storing Vectors

Use `vector upsert` to insert or update a vector by key:

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create docs 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert docs doc-1 [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert docs doc-2 [0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0] --metadata '{"source":"conversation","timestamp":1234567890}'
OK
```

The dimension of the vector must match the collection's dimension. A mismatch returns a `DimensionMismatch` error.

### Batch Upsert

For bulk loading, use `vector batch-upsert` to insert multiple vectors in a single operation:

```bash
strata --cache vector batch-upsert docs '[{"key":"chunk-0","vector":[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],"metadata":{"page":1}},{"key":"chunk-1","vector":[0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0],"metadata":{"page":2}},{"key":"chunk-2","vector":[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0],"metadata":{"page":3}}]'
```

Batch upsert validates all entries before committing. If any entry has an invalid dimension, the entire batch fails atomically (no partial writes).

## Retrieving Vectors

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create docs 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert docs doc-1 [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector get docs doc-1
key=doc-1 vector=[1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] metadata=null
```

## Searching

Search for the `k` most similar vectors to a query:

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create items 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert items a [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert items b [0.9,0.1,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert items c [0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector search items [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] 2
key=a score=1.0000
key=b score=0.9939
```

### Search Result Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `key` | The vector's key |
| `score` | Similarity score (higher = more similar) |
| `metadata` | The vector's metadata (if stored) |

### Metadata Filtering

Search results can be filtered by metadata using 8 operators:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `eq` | Equals | `source == "docs"` |
| `ne` | Not equals | `status != "archived"` |
| `gt` | Greater than | `score > 0.5` |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | `version >= 2` |
| `lt` | Less than | `priority < 10` |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | `age <= 30` |
| `in` | Value in set | `category in ["a", "b"]` |
| `contains` | String contains substring | `name contains "test"` |

```bash
strata --cache vector search items [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] 10 --filter '{"source":{"eq":"docs"}}'
```

Metadata filtering is **post-filter** — the backend returns candidates, then metadata is loaded and filtered. The engine uses adaptive over-fetch (3x, 6x, 12x multipliers) to ensure enough results survive filtering.

## Deleting Vectors

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create docs 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert docs doc-1 [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> vector del docs doc-1
OK
```

## Common Patterns

### RAG Context Store

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Create collection
strata --cache vector create knowledge 384 --metric cosine

# Bulk-index document chunks (generate embeddings externally)
strata --cache vector batch-upsert knowledge '[
  {"key":"chunk-0","vector":[...],"metadata":{"text":"...","source":"docs","chunk_index":0}},
  {"key":"chunk-1","vector":[...],"metadata":{"text":"...","source":"docs","chunk_index":1}}
]'

# Search for relevant context
strata --cache vector search knowledge "[0.1,0.2,...]" 5
```

## Branch Isolation

Vector collections and their data are isolated by branch.

## Space Isolation

Within a branch, vector collections are scoped to the current space. Each space has its own independent set of collections:

```
$ strata --cache
strata:default/default> vector create docs 4 --metric cosine
OK
strata:default/default> vector upsert docs item-1 [1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
OK
strata:default/default> use default other
strata:default/other> vector collections
(empty)
```

See [Spaces](spaces) for the full guide.

## Transactions

Vector operations **do not** participate in transactions. They are executed immediately and are always visible, even within a session that has an active transaction.
