Real-world patterns and recipes for building with StrataDB.

- **[Agent State Management](agent-state-management.md)** — KV for config, StateCell for status, EventLog for audit
- **[Multi-Agent Coordination](multi-agent-coordination.md)** — shared databases, CAS coordination, branch isolation
- **[RAG with Vectors](rag-with-vectors.md)** — store embeddings, search similar, combine with KV context
- **[Deterministic Replay](deterministic-replay.md)** — record nondeterministic inputs, replay later
- **[A/B Testing with Branches](ab-testing-with-branches.md)** — run two strategies, compare results
